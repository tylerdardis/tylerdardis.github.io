		<h1>About Me</h1>
		<p>Welcome to my webpage, my name is Tyler Dardis, and am from a small town in southern Minnesota called
		St. Clair. I graduated from high school in 2016, and went to the University of Minnesota for one semester
		to study architecture and film. I then moved back home to complete some generals at South Central Community College
		in North Mankato for a semester. After that I applied to Minnesota State University, Mankato</p>
		<p>I am currently a Geography student at Minnesota State University of Mankato, graduating in the Spring of 2019. 
		A lot of my course work revolves around using GIS and how to apply it in real world situations. This includes
		backgrounds in cartographic design, remote sensing, and working with the most prominent GIS softwares like ArcGIS
		and ERDAS Imagine. I have backgrounds in Architecture, Computer Systems and Networking, as well as Web Design (HTML,
		CSS and Javascript). I am moving up to Minneapolis this summer, and begin my career and using GIS to solve problems
		that people face, in whatever field that may be. Some of my interests would be in Environmental Planning, Urban Planning,
		or even a future in Architecture. I'm open to learning and exploring new fields of interest and broaden my horizons past
		my knowledge from college.</p>
